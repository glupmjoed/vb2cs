vb2cs
=====

vb2cs is a command line wrapper for SharpDevelop's
link:https://github.com/icsharpcode/CodeConverter/[VB.NET â‡¨ C# converter].

Setup
-----

For the script to work, you need to build the `CodeConverterCLI` project with a
C# toolchain.

The project depends on SharpDevelop's `CodeConverter` version 5.5.0, which should be installed automatically if you follow xref:installation-linux[the instructions below].

Alternatively, `CodeConverter` may be installed manually through a link:https://www.nuget.org/packages/ICSharpCode.CodeConverter/[a .NET package manager] or link:https://github.com/icsharpcode/CodeConverter/[build from source]. If you undertake the journey of building everything yourself, be aware that `CodeConverter` itself depends heavily on the `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis` (Roslyn) package, which must also be obtained link:https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis/[from a package] or link:https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn[from source].

[[installation-linux]]
Example: Linux with .NET Core CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the `dotnet` command is already available on your system, you can skip
directly to xref:clone-and-build[cloning and building the project]. Otherwise,
continue below.

Install the .NET SDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Locate your distribution specific instructions in
link:https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/linuxubuntu[this guide] and
follow steps 1 and 2.

E.g. on Ubuntu 16.04:

Add Microsoft's server as a package source:

[source,shell]
$ curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc |
      gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg

[source,shell]
$ sudo mv microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg

[source,shell]
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-xenial-prod xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list'

Install the SDK:

[source,shell]
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-2.1.4

Disable Obnoxious Spying
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Microsoft distribute binaries of their
link:https://github.com/dotnet/cli[otherwise free and open source .NET Core CLI
tool] with
link:https://www.microsoft.com/net/dotnet_library_license.htm[weird licensing
requirements] and with
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/telemetry[telemetry
enabled] per default. The telemetry can be disabled for the current shell session
by setting the environment variable `DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` to
`1`:

[source,shell]
$ export DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1

It can be turned off permanently by adding the above command to your `.bashrc`,
`.profile` or similar shell configuration file.

[[clone-and-build]]
Clone and build project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[source,shell]
$ git clone https://github.com/glupmjoed/vb2cs.git
$ cd vb2cs/CodeConverterCLI

Identify the correct
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog#linux-rids[runtime
identifier] for your platform, and pass it to the build command with the `-r`
flag, e.g.:

[source,shell]
$ dotnet build -r ubuntu.16.04-x64

This command automatically installs any project dependencies globally (`/usr/share/dotnet`) and compiles the project for the target platform. It should complete with the message "Build succeeded.", along with some statistics.

If you need to distribute the resulting binary, you may instead want to use `dotnet publish`. It link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish?tabs=netcore2x[includes all dependencies in a local subdirectory] when building the project.

Optionally, return to the project root folder to use the `vb2sh.sh` script:

[source,shell]
$ cd ..


Usage
-----

The shell script (`vb2cs.sh`) reads Visual Basic .NET code from `stdin` and
writes the corresponding C# code to `stdout`.

[source,shell]
$ cat file.vb | ./vb2cs.sh
