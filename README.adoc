vb2cs
=====

vb2cs is a command line wrapper for SharpDevelop's
link:https://github.com/icsharpcode/CodeConverter/[VB.NET â‡¨ C# converter].

== Setup

For the script to work, you need to compile the C# project in the
`CodeConverterCLI/` folder with a .NET toolchain. If you already have the
`CodeConverterCLI` binary available, you can jump directly to the xref:usage[
usage instructions].

The project depends on SharpDevelop's CodeConverter version 5.5.0, which should
be installed automatically if you follow the xref:installation-linux[setup
example] below.

Alternatively, CodeConverter may be installed manually through a
link:https://www.nuget.org/packages/ICSharpCode.CodeConverter/[.NET package
manager] or link:https://github.com/icsharpcode/CodeConverter/[build from
source]. If you undertake the journey of building everything yourself, be aware
that CodeConverter depends heavily on the Microsoft.CodeAnalysis (Roslyn)
package, which must similarly be obtained
link:https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis/[as a binary package]
or link:https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn[build from source].

[[installation-linux]]
=== Example: Linux with .NET Core CLI

If the `dotnet` command is already available on your system, you can skip
directly to xref:clone-and-build[cloning and building the project]. Otherwise,
continue below.

==== Install the .NET SDK

Locate your distribution-specific instructions in
link:https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/linuxubuntu[this guide] and
follow steps 1 and 2.

E.g. on Ubuntu 16.04:

Add Microsoft's server as a package source:

[source,shell]
$ curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc |
      gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg

[source,shell]
$ sudo mv microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg

[source,shell]
$ sudo sh -c 'echo deb [arch=amd64] \
https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-xenial-prod xenial main >\
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list'

Install the SDK:

[source,shell]
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-2.1.4

==== Disable Obnoxious Spying

Microsoft distribute binaries of their
link:https://github.com/dotnet/cli[otherwise free and open source .NET Core CLI
tool] with
link:https://www.microsoft.com/net/dotnet_library_license.htm[weird licensing
requirements] and
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/telemetry[telemetry
enabled] per default. The telemetry can be disabled for the current shell session
by setting the environment variable `DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` to
`1`:

[source,shell]
$ export DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1

It can be turned off permanently by adding the above command to your `.bashrc`,
`.profile` or similar shell configuration file.

[[clone-and-build]]
==== Clone and build project

[source,shell]
$ git clone https://github.com/glupmjoed/vb2cs.git
$ cd vb2cs/CodeConverterCLI

Identify the
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog#linux-rids[runtime
identifier] for your platform, and pass it to the build command with the `-r`
flag, e.g.:

[source,shell]
$ dotnet build -r ubuntu.16.04-x64

This command automatically installs any project dependencies globally
(/usr/share/dotnet/...), compiles the project for the target platform, and
places the resulting binary in a subdirectory of the current working directory
($PWD/bin/Debug/...). It should complete with the message "Build succeeded.",
along with some statistics.

If you need to distribute the resulting binary, the
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish?tabs=netcore2x[
`dotnet publish`] subcommand might be a better choice. It includes all
dynamically linked dependencies in a local subdirectory when building the
project.

Optionally, return to the project root folder to use the `vb2sh.sh` script:

[source,shell]
$ cd ..


[[usage]]
== Usage

You'll need link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29[Bash] or a
similar shell environment to execute the script (`vb2cs.sh`).

The script read a Visual Basic .NET program from `stdin` and writes the
corresponding C# code to `stdout`, e.g.:

[source,shell]
$ ./vb2cs.sh < file.vb
[ C# code is printet to the terminal ]

[source,shell]
$ ./vb2cs.sh < file.vb > output.cs
[ C# code is piped to the file output.cs ]

Alternatively, the input file name can be read from an optional first command
line argument:

[source,shell]
$ ./vb2cs.sh file.vb
[ C# code is printet to the terminal ]

[source,shell]
$ ./vb2cs.sh file.vb > output.cs
[ C# code is piped to the file output.cs ]

=== Command-line options

The script's behaviour can be changed with a few different flags, described below.

==== -b

`vb2cs.sh` searches the `CodeConverterCLI/bin/Debug/` folder recursively and uses the first file named `CodeConverterCLI` it finds as its code conversion binary. If your binary lives in another directory or has another name (e.g. `CodeConverterCLI.exe`), use the `-b` flag to specify an alternative path:

[source,shell]
$ ./vb2cs.sh -b /path/to/my/codeconverter file.vb
[ C# code is printet to the terminal ]

[source,shell]
$ echo "passthrough" | ./vb2cs.sh -b cat
passthrough

==== -r

The script normally outputs C# code with Unix-style line-endings (`\n`). Use the `-r` flag if you want `\r\n` line-endings:

[source,shell]
$ ./vb2cs.sh file.vb > a.cs
$ ./vb2cs.sh -r file.vb > b.cs
$ file [ab].cs
a.cs: ASCII text
b.cs: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators
